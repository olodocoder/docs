title: 'You Seek Them'
description: '...and they leave you in turmoil.'
---
I was reading Meditations by Marcus Aurelius, and the paragraph below jumped out at me: 👇🏿
<Warning>**Meditations Book 11 V.11:** 
It’s the pursuit of these things, and your attempts to avoid them, that leave you in such turmoil. And yet they aren’t seeking you out; you are the one seeking them.</Warning>

Probably because I've tried and failed to distance myself from social media a lot of times because the overconsumption has proven to be bad for me in various aspects, especially mentally.

The paragraph above reiterated that and gave me a sense of control over my situation. At the same time, it shows how timeless the wisdom of the stoics is. 

Essentially, what that piece of text is saying is that:

1. Your indulgence in these things bother you.
2. Your struggle to stop indulging in them is hard, thus affecting you negatively, too.
3. But you can stop, only if you want to, because they don't have any power over you. 
4. You have all the control, you just need to use it decisively!

And indeed, I looked at it properly, and every single thing(good or bad) I indulge in is of my own doing. Sure! there might be a little nudge here and there from the manipulators of today's world, but in the end, I, myself, say yes or no to these things.

I read somewhere years back that an average human makes around 35K decisions in a single day, and on the surface, I wouldn’t have guessed that I make that many decisions every day but after thinking about it for a bit, I realized that I do. 

Picking up the phone to check Gmail, IG, X, WhatsApp, and many other actions might seem automatic, but there was a brief decision-making process that happened in a few seconds in my brain, which led to me performing that action. 

Being conscious of what I just described is a huge deal because bringing these little subconscious decisions to the conscious mind before acting on them might just change everything for me.

I'll leave myself with another saying of Marcus Aurelius:
